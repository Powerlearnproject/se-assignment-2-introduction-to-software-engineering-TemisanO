Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools in the development and maintenance of high-quality software system. It comprises of the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products like the following: 
a.	Operating systems e.g. Windows OS, MAC OS, Linux OS etc.
b.	Specialized financial applications e.g. Finacle banking application, Globus banking application, PayPal etc.
c.	AI applications e.g. ChatGPT, Siri, Alexa, Ada Suppurt etc.
Software engineering involves the systematic and methodical implementation of all aspects of software creation which extends over the entire life cycle of a software, from the design phase to the maintenance phase. On the other hand, traditional programming is the writing of code to solve specific tasks or problems, often focusing on a single application or software.

Key differences between software engineering and traditional programming are:
•	Scope and Focus: Traditional coding focusses on writing code to solve specific problems or accomplish particular tasks while Software engineering encompasses the entire process of software development including requirement analysis, design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance.
•	Methodology: Traditional programming may not follow a formal methodology or structured process whereas with software engineering, systematic and structured methodologies such as Agile, Waterfall etc. are adhered to.
•	Goals: Primary goal for traditional programming is to create a working program that fulfills the immediate requirement while software engineering aims to develop high-quality software that is reliable, efficient, maintainable and scalable.
•	Team Collaboration: Traditional programming is often done by individuals or small teams with less emphasis on collaboration while software engineering involves larger teams with defined roles e.g. developers, testers, project managers etc.
•	Quality Assurance: For traditional programming testing and debugging may be less formal and rigorous while software engineering includes formal testing, quality assurance processes, code reviews and adherence to standards.
•	Documentation: for traditional programming, documentation may be minimal or informal whereas for software engineering, documentation is a key component and therefore comprehensive, covering all phase of the development process including user manuals.
•	Maintenance: Traditional programming may not account for long term maintenance and updates while software engineering considers maintenance as a critical phase with plans for updates, bug fixes and enhances throughout the software life cycle.


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

The software Development Life Cycle comprises of the following phases:
•	Planning: This phase involves identifying the scope and purpose of the project, conducting required feasibility studies and cost-benefit analysis and developing a project plan
•	Requirement analysis: The gathering and documentation of user needs and system requirements
•	Design: Developing high-level detailed designs of system architecture and user interface
•	Implementation: Writing the actual code base on design specifications while adhering to coding standards and best practices
•	Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure software quality standards are specified requirements are met
•	Deployment: Preparing and releasing the software to a live environment for users or customers
•	Maintenance: Provide ongoing maintenance, support, updates and enhancements for the software, ensuring it remains functional and relevant over time
•	Review and evaluation: Assessing the projects success and compliance to requirements through feedback from users and stakeholders while documenting lessons learned and best practices for future projects


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

The Agile model for Software Development refers to a group of software methodologies that are based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams based on flexibility and response to change. Instead of delivering a final working product at the end of the development lifecycle, teams work in small called sprints, which are usually one to three weeks. However, the waterfall model, unlike the Agile model, follows a sequential and linear process i.e., it comprises of distinct phases wherein each phase must be completed for the next the next one to commence.

a.	Clear and defined objectives: The Agile model of software development allows for changes in project requirements at any stage of development whereas with the Waterfall model all requirements are concluded at the onset of the development process providing clear and defined objectives making planning and managing the project easier.
b.	Predictable outcomes: Since the Waterfall methodology follows a sequential process, predicting the projects outcome is easier than that for the Agile methodology. This makes estimating the time and resources required for each project phase easier with the Waterfall model.
c.	Documentation: The Waterfall model of Software Development requires more detailed documentation than the Agile model due to its structured nature. This level of documentation makes the project easier to maintain and update in the future with Waterfall model.
d.	Adaptability: The Agile model of Software Development is an iterative approach and therefore allows for flexibility and adaptability. The project can be adjusted based on stake holder feedbacks or market changes unlike the waterfall model which is rigid in that it does not allow for changes once the project has commenced.
e.	Faster Time to Market: Because the Agile model is iterative, it allows for faster development and deployment of the software project.
f.	Collaboration: The Agile model of Software Development highlights the collaboration between the development team and the stakeholders. This collaboration helps to ensure that the software project meets the needs of the stakeholders and that everyone is on the same page.

Depending on the project size, complexity, risk factors, and the team and stakeholders’ preferences, an Agile model for Software Development is best suited for projects requiring flexibility and constant requirement changes, such as software developments projects where customer feedback and engagement are critical during the development process. On the other hand, Waterfall is ideal for projects with well-defined stages and straightforward, line requirements where there is a clear beginning and end, well defined requirements and a fixed scope for unexpected changes requiring a high level of documentation and planning.


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements Engineering for Software Engineering, is a disciplined approach to eliciting, analyzing, documenting, validating and managing the needs and requirements of stakeholders for a new software.

a.	Eliciting: This involves gathering requirements from stakeholders, including customers, end-users, and other relevant parties. Techniques used include interviews, questionnaires, user observation, workshops and brainstorming sessions.
b.	Analysis: This step focuses on examining the gathered requirements to identify conflicts, ambiguities, and inconsistencies. It involves prioritizing requirements, understanding the feasibility, and creating models to represent the requirements.
c.	Documentation: Once requirements are elicited and analyzed, they are documented in a clear and organized manner. This can take the form of requirements specifications, user stories, or use case documents. The documentation must be comprehensive and understandable for all stakeholders.
d.	Validation: This ensures that the documented requirements accurately reflect the stakeholders’ needs and are feasible within the constraints of the project. Validation techniques include reviews, prototyping, and acceptance testing.
e.	Management: Requirements management involves tracking and controlling changes to the requirements throughout the project’s lifecycle. It includes maintaining traceability of requirements, managing versions, and handling requirements changes due to evolving stakeholder needs or project constraints.

Effective requirements engineering helps to ensure that the software developed meets the needs of its users and stakeholders, is delivered on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards. It also helps in minimizing rework and errors, which can be costly and time-consuming to fix later in the development process.


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design is a principle that involves dividing a software system into distinct, independent units or modules, each of which encapsulates a specific functionality or set of related functionalities. These modules can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, which enhances the manageability, flexibility, and scalability of the software system. Each module hides its internal implementation details and exposes only necessary interfaces to interact with other modules. Modularity promotes reusability, as individual modules can often be reused across different parts of an application or in different software development projects without modification. An example of the concept of modularity in software design can be found in the use of Classes and Objects, in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) wherein data and behavior are encapsulated into reusable components.

a.	Maintainability: By breaking down the software system into manageable modules, it becomes easier to understand, maintain, and update the system. Bug fixes, updates, and enhancements can be made to individual modules without affecting the entire system.
b.	Scalability: Modularity allows the software system to scale more efficiently. New features and functionalities can be added by creating new modules without altering the existing system architecture significantly.


Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

The different levels of Software Testing:
a.	Unit Testing: This is the testing of individual components, modules or units of code to verify that they function correctly. It involves the testing of individual functions, methods or classes in isolation by developers using tools like Junit, NUnit and pytest.
b.	Integration Testing: This is the testing of interactions between different components, modules, units and units of code to ensure they work together as expected. It involves testing the interactions and interfaces between integrated components by developers or dedicated testers. Approaches that could be used for integration testing are Top-Down Integration, Bottom-Up integration or Sandwich/Hybrid integration.
c.	System Testing: This is the testing of the entire software system as a whole, validating the complete and integrated software system. It involves testing the entire software system's compliance with the specified requirements. There are 2 types of System Testing:
i.	Functional Testing: Ensures the system functions according to the requirements.
ii.	Non-Functional Testing: Which includes performance, usability, reliability, and security testing.
Some of the tools used for System testing are Selenium, LoadRunner and JMeter.

Testing is a crucial part of the of the software development process because it identifies potential issues before they reach the end-users, reducing the likelihood of software failures and associated financial risks. It ensures that the software is functional, reliable, secure, and performs as required, ultimately leading to higher quality software products and satisfied users.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version Control Systems (VCS), are software tools used to track and manage changes to source code over time. They coordinate work among team members simultaneously working on same project, tracking revisions and maintaining a history of changes.
Version Control Systems are important in Software Development for the following reasons:
i.	Collaboration: They facilitate teamwork by allowing multiple developers to work on different parts of the same project simultaneously.
ii.	History and Auditability: They maintain a detailed history of changes, aiding in tracking progress and debugging issues.
iii.	Backup and Recovery: They protect against data loss by providing a means to revert to previous versions.
iv.	Branching and Experimentation: They enable developers to experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.
v.	Continuous Integration: They Integrate well with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines e.g., GitLab, automating testing and deployment processes.
Examples of popular Version Control Systems and their features:

Sample of Version Control Systems (VCS):
a.	Git: It is distributed, widely used, fast, and flexible. Supports branching and merging. Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide hosting and collaboration features. It is favored for open-source and enterprise projects.
b.	Subversion (SVN): It is centralized and known for simplicity and reliability. Strong support for binary files. It is often used in legacy systems and organizations with a centralized control preference.
c.	Mercurial: It is distributed, similar to Git, but emphasizes simplicity and performance. It is used by projects that require robust and scalable version control.
